Welcome. I'm Kevin Pan, an experienced data scientist who has made the transition into technical innovation and intrapreneurship.

In my current role at Strivr, I am building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) to write custom content based on our company's data. Outside of Strivr, I've also built custom apps to explore data through natural language (askdata.app)[https://askdata.app].

My background has been in both more traditional data science, as well as product driven data science, economic consulting, and some algorithm development at a hedge fund.

On Lyft's Integrity team I led experimentation, data modeling and migration (including GDPR), loss forecasting and segmentation, and weekly team syncs to mitigate fraudulent activities. I learned a lot but wanted to get a more holistic view of the business, so I moved to the Delivery team, which was more of a start-up within Lyft.

On the Delivery team, I found ways to both grow volume and improve our quality through diving into data and partnerships. It was exciting but also challenging to build a new product that both used existing infrastructure but also needed new elements, in a space with well-funded competitors. I learned a great deal about focusing on users, and understanding the Why of what we were building.

Capitalizing on my passion for coding and problem-solving, I gradually transitioned from data science into a more development-oriented role. I found that I enjoyed talking directly to users to build the product that they need.

I now focus on the development and scaling of new products within my organization. By leveraging my expertise in data analysis and software development, I love helping unlock value for people and organizations.

If you're also looking to build new products within your organization or outside of it, please reach out at (hello@kpan.dev)[mailto:hello@kpan.dev]. I'd love to chat.
